# Trombone Animator

Used to generate the youtube video found here: https://youtu.be/eBwQ0RnvL9k

Takes in a MIDI file and orders images according to slide positions.

The intent is for this to be used to make dynamically-generated trombone GIFs, but I suppose you could use it to animate any series of seven images according to a midi file. 

This likely has issues with drift over very long MIDI files. This was hastily assembled over the course of a day.
